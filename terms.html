              <p>Welcome to Golf Menia’s Terms and Conditions of Use. This is a contract between you and the Golf Menia and we want you to know yours and our rights before you use the Golf Menia app. Please take a few moments to read these Terms before enjoying the App, because once you access, view or use the App, you are going to be legally bound by these Terms (so probably best to read them first!).</p>
